# NPC Weapon Customizer
This mod lets you customize NPC weapons by replacing the default weapons with any gun from your inventory. This is only a cosmetic choice which will not effect how NPCs use that gun, damage and fire rate of the original gun will be used. Clients will see the default weapons (unless they also use the mod).

## Known issues
- Menu is a bit buggy (doesn't close inventory when going back), but can still be used normally
